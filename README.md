# Wizard Training

A game for two players made using C++ and SFML.

Player one contols the blue wizard with WASD to move and space to shoot fireballs, while player two uses the Arrow Keys and Right Shift to contol the red wizard.\
Fireballs become weaker as they travel further, so try to get as close as you can before firing, while not getting hit by your opponent!

## How To Build And Run

Simply run the `cmake` command followed by the `make` command in the directory with the `CMakeLists.txt` file, then run the generated executable with `./Wizard-Training`.\
Note: the `Images` directory must be in the same location as the executable for the images and text to render.
